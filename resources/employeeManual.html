                    <p>This Employee Handbook replaces and supersedes any and all prior employee handbooks, personnel policies, procedure manuals, written statements and oral promises.  You are responsible for complying with the policies contained in this handbook.  Please keep the handbook in a convenient place so that it is always available for your review.</p>
                    <p>The Vancouver Bolt Employee Handbook is a guideline only.  It has been designed to give you a ready source of information about Vancouver Bolt and the way that we work together.  Of course, it cannot answer all your questions.  Remember that your immediate supervisor, other managers, and the Accounting/Human Resources offices are also sources of information.</p>
                    <p>This handbook is not intended to be a contract, and it does not create a promise of specific treatment or a guarantee that anyone will be employed for any specific period of time.</p>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt reserves the right to make changes in this handbook in the future to meet the changing needs of the company and its employees.  This includes the right to add, modify, rescind, or eliminate any policy or benefit at any time.  Vancouver Bolt also reserves the right to deviate from these policies and use its discretion in making all employment decisions.  No statement or promise by anyone other than the President of Vancouver Bolt, in writing, may be interpreted as a change in policy.</p>

                    <p>It is the commitment of Vancouver Bolt & Supply to ensure fair and equal treatment for everyone in our employ.  We believe employment, training and promotion opportunities should be available to all persons without regard to race, age, religion, gender, color, national origin, creed, disability, sexual orientation or military status.</p>
                    <p>Our selection, training, promotion, and other employment practices are based on job-related qualifications.  Our employment solicitations affirm that we are an equal opportunity employer.  We strive to comply with all laws that regulate employment practices.</p>
                    <p>The Company is committed to compliance with <i>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</i>.  To this end, we conduct all recruitment in an ethical, professional, and non-discriminatory manner.  Those seeking assistance in completing an application form or accommodation to participate in employment interviews, because of disability, will be accommodated.  Efforts are made to accommodate those who can perform the essential functions of the job to enjoy employment opportunities with Vancouver Bolt & Supply.</p>

                    <p>Our first concern is service to the customer.  This commitment is not simply financial.  It is essential for our survival and growth that we have a reputation in our industry that we are flexible, committed and reliable.  As an employer, we uphold the respect and dignity of the worker regarding the rights and responsibilities of the employees and the employer.  In this regard, we face tremendous challenges in a highly competitive environment.</p>
                    <p>To achieve this end, the company believes that mutual trust between employer and employee creates a positive environment, which results in the highest quality care.  Effective employer-employee relations can best be achieved in an open and enlightened direct relationship among the independent individuals involved.  We will vigorously oppose the interference from any outside group that attempts to destroy our employee/employer relationship.</p>

                    <p>New employees at Vancouver Bolt & Supply will have up to twelve calendar weeks to familiarize themselves with the job.  This is a time for us to evaluate your work.  During this time, you will want to demonstrate your ability and desire to become a regular employee.  At any time during this time period of new learning, we may decide you will not be retained as part of our regular workforce.  If that is our decision, you will be informed immediately.</p>
                    <p>During this time, employees are expected to learn every aspect of the job.  Those fulfilling this expectation are eligible to be considered Regular Employees, and become eligible for the benefits reserved for regular employees.  </p>
                    <p>It is very important for you to know that we work in an <b>“at-will” (voluntary)</b> relationship.  That means that you are free to leave our employment and we are free to terminate the employment relationship at any time with or without cause.  </p>

                    <h2 id="complaintIntro">Complaint and Suggestion Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Our goal is to continue fostering a healthy and productive work environment where employees enjoy working.  Open communication is essential to furthering this policy.  Vancouver Bolt welcomes all of your questions and suggestions.  It is your responsibility to make Vancouver Bolt aware of any problems or difficulties which you may be experiencing at work. Vancouver Bolt may not be aware of a particular problem unless you tell us.</p>
                    <p>To provide for prompt and efficient evaluation of a response to complaints and suggestions, Vancouver Bolt has established a formal Complaint and Suggestion Procedure for all employees. There will be no discrimination against or toward anyone for his or her part in presenting complaints or suggestions. Vancouver Bolt takes all suggestions and complaints seriously and will try, to the extent possible under the circumstances, to keep the communications confidential but cannot guarantee confidentiality. </p>
                    <p>Talking things over usually helps. When you have a complaint or other problem, the person you report to is the person to see first. If this does not settle the matter, please discuss the matter with the Human Resources Manager. </p>


                    <h2>The Complaint and Suggestion Procedure:</h2>
                    <h4>1. See Your Supervisor First, If Possible.</h4>
                    <p>If you feel that any working condition, policy, practice or action by Vancouver Bolt, any member of management or other employee is unjust, or if you have any other concern  or suggestion, you should tell your Supervisor about it and discuss the matter confidentially and in private with him or her. If you decide to do this, please do so in a timely manner, but do not abandon your job responsibilities. Contact your Supervisor or one of the other Supervisors who may have been designated for you to contact before leaving the workplace at the end of your work day.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>2. Put It In Writing.</h4>
                    <p>If, after the discussion with your Supervisor, the situation remains unsettled, the matter should be referred to the Human Resource Manager. You may need to elaborate your complaint or proposed solution by describing the situation or problem further, naming witnesses, if applicable, and making sure to mention any times, dates and places. Also, include a summary of your communications with your Supervisor on the subject. Put this information into an envelope, seal it, and either mail or deliver it to your Human Resources Manager. Of course, your complaint or suggestion may not require all this information, and may be a brief statement of a minor complaint about a working condition or a suggestion. Whatever it is, we want to know about it. </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>3. Complaint/Suggestion Conference.</h4>
                    <p>The Human Resources Manager will review the complaint/suggestion and may discuss it with your Supervisor or call you in for a scheduled conference with or without the presence of your immediate Supervisor. At this conference, you should feel free to openly discuss your complaint or suggestion and substantiate your reasons for feeling the way you do. In most cases, the matter will be resolved by this stage. If you are dissatisfied, you may present your complaint/suggestion in writing to the President or CEO following the same procedures as outlined above. </p>

                    <h2 id="moreInfo">Getting More Information</h2>
                    <p> In addition to the policies contained in this Handbook, you may obtain additional information by reading the policies the posters posted on the bulletin board located in the break room (see policy regarding bulletin boards) or by speaking with the Human Resources Manager.</p>

                    <h2 id="bulletinBoards">Bulletin Boards</h2>
                    <p>Bulletin boards and notices are to keep employees informed about new policies, changes in procedures and special events. Information of general interest is posted regularly on the bulletin boards. Please form the habit of reading the bulletin boards regularly so that you will be familiar with the information posted on them. </p>
                    <p>Only authorized personnel are permitted to post, remove or alter any notice on the bulletin board(s). Under no circumstances shall any obscene material be posted on Vancouver Bolt’s bulletin board(s).</p>

                    <h2 id="employeeMeetings">Employee Meetings</h2>
                    <p>Periodic mandatory Employee Meetings may be called. These meetings are designed to keep you informed of changes in the company policy, to provide information relevant to your job and to give special recognition for outstanding employee contributions.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to add an agenda item, you may submit your request in writing at least two (2) days before the meeting. Please inform the Human Resources Manager if you are unable to attend the meeting. </p>

                    <h2 id="anniversary">Anniversary Date</h2>
                    <p>Once you have successfully completed your introductory period, your date of hire becomes your Anniversary Date at the Company.  If you are uncertain of your Anniversary Date, please check with the Human Resource Administrator. </p>

                    <h2 id="separation">Separation and Re-Hire</h2>
                    <p>Should you elect to leave the Company, we request that you give us a two-week notice.  You will be expected to work during your period of notice and may not receive vacation or sick pay to cover this time period.  Your final paycheck will be ready for you at the next regular payday unless otherwise mandated by law.  Be sure you have returned all Company property in your possession, such as files, equipment, phones and keys.</p>
                    <p>It is important for you to establish a good work record while you are here.  It will be valuable to you in a re-hire decision, and as a reference to other employers.  Those who apply for re-hire will be given consideration equal to other applicants.</p>
                    <p>Involuntary termination of employment is treated in a confidential, professional manner.  This policy, and its administration, will be implemented in accordance with our equal opportunity policy.</p>

                    <h2 id="references">Employment References</h2>
                    <p>Only the Human Resource Administrator is authorized to provide verification of employment or an employment reference.  If you receive a written or phone request for information about a former employee, please refer the request to Human Resources.</p>

                    <h2 id="super">Your Supervisor</h2>
                    <p>Your assigned Supervisor is your main source of information and assistance.  It is the responsibility of your Supervisor to train you [or assign a trainer], and to treat you fairly.  Your immediate Supervisor is the person to help resolve problems, explain policies you do not understood, or direct you to someone else at the Company who can answer your questions.  That person may have the job title of Supervisor or Manager.  Titles are less important than recognizing that you came to the Company in good faith, to do a good job and we are here to ensure that you have that opportunity.  Your Supervisor is vitally interested in helping you do the best job possible. </p>

                    <h2 id="hours">Hours of Work</h2>
                    <p>The normal workweek is Sunday thru Saturday beginning and ending at midnight. The standard workday at Vancouver Bolt & Supply is: </p>
                    <h4><b>7:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., from Monday to Friday.</b></h4>
                    <p>Individual employees work may often work outside the standard business hours of the office.  Specific work schedules are assigned and may be changed by the Supervisor, with consideration given to meeting the needs of the customer.  Your meal breaks are not paid.</p>

                    <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
                    <p>Consistent, prompt arrival for work is necessary to ensure proper operation of the Company.  Employees must notify their immediate Supervisor of anticipated absenteeism or tardiness at the earliest possible time.  You will be expected to notify your Supervisor each day of your absence, unless you report the total time of your absence on the first day of absence.  It is important to talk directly to your Supervisor, not just leave a voice mail message.  All employees are expected to make every effort to arrive and be prepared to work by their assigned shift time.</p>
                    <p>Employees with attendance issues can expect that this problem will be addressed quickly.  Absence affects our ability to provide the kind of service our customers expect.</p>

                    <h2 id="abandon">Job Abandonment</h2>
                    <p>Employees, who are absent from work for three consecutive days, without reporting the absence according to the policy or reporting for work, will be removed from the company payroll.  The employee will be listed as a voluntary quit – job abandonment.</p>

                    <h2 id="personnel">Personnel Records</h2>
                    <p>The Human Resource Management maintains your employment records.  We will keep information that is needed by the Company or is required by Federal, State or Local laws.  This information will normally include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application Form</li>
                        <li>Performance Appraisals</li>
                        <li>Payroll Information</li>
                        <li>Disciplinary Records</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sensitive information, such as medical information, will not be kept in a personnel file that is accessible to anyone without a specific and verifiable need to know.  From time-to-time there may be changes in your status that require a change in your records.  When you move, change telephone numbers, change your marital status, gain or lose dependents, change your tax status, or complete any outside education or training, you need to notify the Human Resource Administrator.</p>
                    <p>You should be especially careful to keep beneficiary records current, and be certain the records administrator has current emergency contact information.  The most recent address and telephone number on file will be used when we need to contact you.</p>
                    <p>As an active employee, you may review the contents of your personnel record in the presence of the HR Administrator. You must make a written request to do so at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the date of the examination. </p>
                    <p>The personnel record is company property and you may not remove, alter, or photocopy any document in the file.  Should you wish to create an addendum to your file, we will accept and include it in your personnel record.</p>

                    <h2 id="visitors">Visitors to the Building</h2>
                    <p>Our facility is open to the public; visitors come and go frequently.  They are our responsibility.  The U. S. Department of Homeland Security has an expectation that employers will safeguard the workplace and assure no one is allowed to access our workplace that is unknown to us.  </p>
                    <p>When you have a scheduled visitor, please have your visitor report to the Front Desk Receptionist.  You will be required to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meet your visitor promptly</li>
                        <li>Stay with your visitor throught the visit</li>
                        <li>Make certain your visitor is not left to find his/her way out of the building</li>
                        <li>Make sure your visitor complies with all of our safety and smoking rules</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Friends and relatives should be asked not to visit employees during work hours.  Unattended children or pets (except those deemed okay by the owner of Vancouver Bolt) are not allowed in the facility or on the premises at any time.  </p>
                    <p>For safety and insurance reasons, friends, relatives and customers are not permitted in areas restricted to employees only.</p>

                    <h2 id="lossProperty">Loss of Property</h2>
                    <p>We all share the responsibility for protecting and preserving employee property.  It is important that you protect your personal property, and take particular care not to leave a handbag unattended or a wallet in your coat pocket or other highly visible area.  The Company cannot accept responsibility for the loss of your personal property.  This includes articles left in your car.  Because expensive articles are a temptation, don’t leave expensive items visible to passersby.</p>
                    <p>Take care to protect our equipment, such as computers, calculators etc.   Because the building is a public building, non-employees may visit in the offices.  Articles found by employees should be turned in to a management representative.</p>

                    <h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>You will be required to accept the terms of our confidentiality agreement.  In order to work here, you must agree to keep work-related information confidential. In the course of employment with Vancouver Bolt employees may learn confidential information (e.g. customer lists, customer needs, preferences or other customer information, business methods and pricing policies).  All nonpublic information belongs solely to Vancouver Bolt, and not to the employees or anyone else.  The law imposes a duty on employees to keep this type of information confidential and to use it only to benefit Vancouver Bolt.  This obligation continues both during and indefinitely after termination of an employee’s employment with Vancouver Bolt.  The legal consequences for disclosing or misusing confidential company information, is severe.</p>
                    <p>Employees, therefore, should not discuss Vancouver Bolt’s business with anyone who does not work for Vancouver Bolt or who is not involved with a transaction that requires that person’s need-to-know specific information in connection with that transaction.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, Vancouver Bolt automatically owns all copyrights on all written materials or computerized information you may prepare in conjunction with your employment with Vancouver Bolt.  The same confidentiality obligations described above apply here as well.</p>
                    <p>Employees cannot copy, distribute or use confidential information or copyrighted materials except as authorized for Vancouver Bolt’s benefit.</p>
                    <p>Upon termination of employment with Vancouver Bolt, employees must immediately return all copies of Vancouver Bolt’s documents, computerized information or other tangible things that reflect Vancouver Bolt’s confidential information.</p>
                    <p>Just as all information obtained or learned while working at Vancouver Bolt must remain confidential, we respect the confidentiality of proprietary and other business information which is the intellectual property of our competitors.  While it is healthy and competitive to gather information fairly in the marketplace, Vancouver Bolt strongly forbids the possession or use of such information obtained while employed by any competitor or by other unethical means.  Employees should notify the President immediately if they anticipate this kind of problem so Vancouver Bolt can take appropriate precautions.</p>
                    <p>If an employee has any questions about whether this policy applies to a specific situation, he or she should contact the President.  Employees are responsible for resolving any confidentiality question in advance.  If an employee has any doubt about the confidentiality or copyright status of any material, the employee should assume that it is protected and that its use or disclosure is restricted under this policy.</p>
                    <p>Confidential information includes trade secrets, financial, technical and marketing information, pricing, designs, and information about employees.  Price lists, product development and business plans are considered proprietary information now and forever.  If you are asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, that document will be part of your employee file.  However, accepting employment is your commitment to confidentiality.</p>

                    <h2 id="overtime">Employees Subject to Overtime Pay</h2>
                    <p>The determination of your pay status is not made by your job title or location.  It is made by evaluating the kind of work you perform.  Some employees are subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Employees subject to the overtime provisions of FLSA are described as <i>Non-Exempt.</i>  </p>
                    <p>Employees not subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act are described as Exempt.  As an exempt employee, you are paid a fixed salary for performing a scope of work.  Exempt employees are not paid by the hour, and are not subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Exempt employees are expected to work until the job is finished.  </p>
                    <p>Overtime pay is covered by federal and state laws and varies from state-to-state.  If you are a non-exempt employee, you will be paid for all of the hours you work according to the laws of your state and the federal wage and hour laws.  Thus, before you start to work early, or work beyond the normal workday, you must get advance permission because overtime pay represents an expense to the company.  It is important to be in your work area at the start of the workday, but wait until the start of the workday to begin working.</p>
                    <p>As a non-exempt employee, your hours of work must be recorded accurately.  <i>It is required by law.</i>  The record of hours worked is used to calculate your paycheck.  When you do not properly record your time, it is urgent that you notify your Supervisor right away.  An incorrect time record causes an inaccurate paycheck.</p>
                    <p>You may not record time for another employee, or have another employee record your time.  We consider this practice to be an act of dishonesty and can result in disciplinary action, including discharge.</p>

                    <h2 id="time">Time Records</h2>
                    <p>All hourly employees are responsible for keeping accurate time records using the time clock.  Clock-in time is the time you start work – not the time you arrive.  If you are scheduled to start at 7:30, for example, you may want to arrive a few minutes earlier to get a cup of coffee or us the restroom.  Similarly, clock-out time is the time you stop work – the time you leave your station.</p>
                    <p>If you have errors on your time card (forget to punch in or out) there is a Time Clock Exception Report that must be filled out, signed off by your supervisor and turned into the Payroll Department.</p>
                    <p>All employees, hourly and salaried, are responsible for turning in a Leave Form for any work time missed.  </p>
                    <p>Non-exempt employees are responsible for turning in an Overtime Form for any time worked over 40 hours per week.  The form must be signed by the employee, the supervisor and turned into the Payroll Department at least two days prior to the next payday.  For a more complete explanation of Leave and Overtime policies, please refer to those section of the Employee Handbook.</p>
                    <p>Falsifying time records or recording time on another employee’s time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
                    <p>Failure to turn in time records or appropriate forms may result in errors or lack of payment.  Vancouver Bolt will do its best to resolve any problems or errors, but it is the employee’s responsibility to make sure all appropriate paperwork is submitted in a timely fashion.</p>
                    <p>For the health of our employees and the health of the company, it is the policy of Vancouver Bolt that all employees should be able to accomplish their required work within a 40-hour workweek.  Overtime should be necessary only under exceptional circumstances.  If you find you are regularly having trouble accomplishing your work within a 40-hour workweek, meet with your supervisor and General Manager to discuss ways to better manage or reduce your work-load.</p>

                    <h2 id="rest">Rest Periods</h2>
                    <p>No reduction in pay is made for a 10 minute rest period for each 4-hour work period, scheduled as near as possible to midpoint of each work period.  This rest period, taken away from the work area, will be in addition to any designated meal period.  If you are in an area where employees usually take their breaks, please do your part to keep it clean.  Return to work promptly when your rest period ends. Check with your Supervisor for specific times. </p>

                    <h2 id="meal">Meal Period</h2>
                    <p>During any designated meal period for which employees are not paid, no work is expected from employees.  Non-exempt employees, on a non-paid meal period, may not perform work unless specifically instructed to do so by the Supervisor.  Whenever this occurs, an alternative meal period will be arranged or appropriate compensation will be arranged.</p>

                    <h2 id="weather">Weather Emergencies</h2>
                    <p>In the event of an emergency or a natural disaster, such as bad weather, you may be asked to report to work.  Employees, not essential to the operation, will be instructed to stay at home.  The nature of our work means we have deadlines, and our staffing needs will be based on these needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        We will always comply with the instructions of officials managing disasters on behalf of the government.  When a weather emergency occurs, we may be forced to close our offices.  If weather deteriorates during the day, you may be allowed to leave early, depending on the severity of the weather condition and the urgency of our work. If you are asked to report for work, please remember:
                        <b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE should you risk accident or injury to report to work.</b>  Your personal safety is our greatest concern.  When hourly employees are absent due to a weather emergency, the absence will be unpaid.  There may be an opportunity to make up the lost time during the same workweek, or you may use vacation time, if available. If Vancouver Bolt is closed due to severe inclement weather for less than a full week, exempt but not non-exempt employees will receive compensation.  No adjustment will be made for employees who are currently on vacation or sick leave.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="breaks">Breaks-In-Service</h2>
                    <p>No break in continuous service will occur from any of the following: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An approved sickness, accident, or other qualifying leaves of absence of no more than six weeks.</li>
                        <li>Time spent in military service to the United States, provided the veteran complies with the requirements of USERRA.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="layoff">Layoff and Recall</h2>
                    <p>The nature of our work makes it essential that we have employees with certain skills.  The management will always maintain its responsibility to determine the size of the workforce.  Layoff, should it be necessary, and recall, will be based on maintaining a workforce comprised of highly skilled employees to meet the needs of our customers.  Employees in certain job classes are critical to the ongoing operation and, necessarily, will be given preference.</p>

                    <h2 id="equipment">Equipment and Supplies</h2>
                    <p>Our supplies and equipment are part of the operating costs of our business, and are very expensive.  They must be used only for Company business.  Personal use of stationery, postage, copiers, pens etc., is not acceptable, this includes the use of our copy machines for personal use.</p>

                    <h2 id="mail">Mail</h2>
                    <p>All incoming mail upon receipt should be given to the designated person.  All outgoing mail should be deposited in the “outgoing basket” near the receptionist.</p>
                    <p>You are expected to separate your personal life from work.  Vancouver Bolt’s address may not be used for personal mail.  Any personal mail delivered to Vancouver Bolt may be returned to the Post Office, unless specifically authorized.  Under no circumstances are any employees to use company postage for personal mail.</p>

                    <h2 id="telephones">Telephones</h2>
                    <p>The telephone is one of our most important business tools.  We have a limited number of telephones and a limited number of hours when customers can reach us.  We must all strive to keep the telephone lines open for business.  From time-to-time, you may have an emergency that requires you to place and/or receive personal calls.  Please be time conscious, and keep personal calls to a minimum.</p>
                    <p>No personal long distance calls may be made, or charged, to the Company without prior permission from a Supervisor, and the presence of an emergency.</p>
                    <p>Should an employee abuse the telephone calling privilege, thus creating a problem for customers who need to reach us, the employee can expect to have the offending behavior addressed and corrected. </p>

                    <h2 id="personalTelephones">Personal Telephones</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is important that we address, separately, the subject of personal phones.  This includes both cellular and digital phones.  If you are assigned to certain positions here, you may be required to carry and use a personal telephone.  Other employees may have a personal telephone at work if they do not interfere with the job.
                        <b>It is our request that you keep your personal phone silenced during the workday.  You may neither receive, nor place, a call that is not absolutely essential.  This includes text messaging and emailing.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>If your job requires you to perform a procedure that could be dangerous, operate equipment with an electric motor, or other equipment that can injure or kill, then you may not have a personal cell phone in our possession while on duty.  The sudden ring or vibration of the personal phone can be startling or distracting.</p>
                    <p>No employee may use a personal telephone to record any conversation or to take any unauthorized photograph.  To do so will result in immediate dismissal.  We are unable to accept responsibility for your personal telephone if it is lost or stolen while at work.</p>
                    <p>If you are traveling on Company business, you may need to place and/or receive business-related calls on your personal phone.  Unless it is an emergency, or you have a hands-free telephone, we believe it is in the best interest of your safety, and the safety of other travelers, that you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place all calls while your vehicle is stopped</li>
                        <li>Answer any calls, while you are driving, with a request that you return the call as soon as you are able to stop your vehicle</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b><i>In certain locations, you are prohibited by law from using a personal telephone while driving.  You must obey these regulations.</i></b></p>

                    <h2 id="ped">Personal Electronic Devices</h2>
                    <p>Federal and State laws require that certain information must be kept confidential.  This includes all information related to employee medical and personal data.  The company expects employees to protect price lists, customer lists, marketing plans and other business data.  Employees, who have a laptop, Blackberry®, IPhone®, or other personal electronic device with the capacity to store information , must protect the device from loss or unauthorized access to company/employee information.   </p>
                    <p>Precautions that must be taken by all employees with PEDs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Password protect every device</li>
                        <li>Make certain all data is encrypted</li>
                        <li>Establish a pass phrase</li>
                        <li>Use only secure wireless networks</li>
                        <li>Establish a 10 minute "Time Out" limit with re-access only with the password</li>
                        <li>Make certain the make, model, and serial number is recorded in case of theft</li>
                        <li>Establish a two-step authentication process for copying</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you need assistance to protect your PED, please see the IT Administrator and notify IT if your PED is lost or stolen. </p>
                    <p><b><i>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO WIPE YOUR DEVICE OF ALL DATA.</i></b></p>

                    <h2 id="social">Social Events</h2>
                    <p>When the Company hosts a social event for employees, attendance is not mandatory and no additional compensation is made.  Social events are part of our effort to provide opportunities for employees, and their families, to enjoy a time of social interaction.</p>

                    <h2 id="performance">Performance Reviews</h2>
                    <p>The performance review system is designed to help you be successful on the job.  You can expect to have a periodic performance review that reviews past performance and identifies your developmental needs.  Both you and your Supervisor should be well-prepared for the time you spend during the performance review.  You are encouraged to actively participate in the review process.</p>

                    <h2 id="companyVan">Company Vehicle Use</h2>
                    <p>Employees may only use their personal vehicle for Vancouver Bolt business when specifically requested to do so by their Supervisor.  The employee must have accident and liability insurance in the amount set by Vancouver Bolt on their vehicle in order to be used for company business.</p>
                    <p>All employees or applicants for employment who would drive company vehicles as a regular part of their job duties must authorize Vancouver Bolt to check their vehicle driving records.  See Authorization to Verify Driving Record.  Driving record must meet the following standards:</p>

                        <li>No more than one accident in the last three years</li>
                        <li>No more than one violation and one accident in the last three years</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An accident means a driving occurrence resulting in bodily injury, death, or property damage for which the employee is held liable.

                    <h2 id="employmentClassifications">Employment Classifications</h2>

                    <h3>Regular Employee</h3>
                    <p>An employee whose employment is of indefinite duration is a regular employee.  Regular employees may work full time (forty (40) or more hours per week) or part time (work fewer than forty (40) hours per week).</p>

                    <h3>Commissioned Employee</h3>
                    <p>Those individual who are hired as commissioned employees sign an agreement detailing the amount of commission that will be paid, when it will be paid, and other pertinent details.  New customers are designated to the appropriate commissioned employee or as house accounts.  Employees have access to such designation. Commissions are not earned until Vancouver Bolt has received a purchase order or check from the customer designated to the employee and the service or equipment has been delivered to the customer. Commissions are payable on the last pay period of the month following date of sale. Vancouver Bolt reserves the right to withhold or recover commissions paid for sales to a customer if that customer’s account receivable is not paid within 90 days.</p>

                    <h3>Exempt Employee</h3>
                    <p>This category includes all employees who are classified by Vancouver Bolt as exempt from the overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable state laws. Exempt employees may include executive, administrative and management employees and outside commissioned sales personnel.</p>
                    <p>
                        Exempt employees are hired to perform their job and meet performance or production expectations. This may require more or fewer hours. Hours are not monitored for compensation purposes, but performance is reviewed and employees are expected to “get the job done.”
                        Deductions from compensation are made, however, when an exempt employee is absent from work for a day or more for personal reasons other than sickness or accident, jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Non-Exempt Employee</h3>
                    <p>This category includes all employees who are covered by the overtime provision of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and any applicable state laws.  Non-exempt employees are paid for hours worked and are entitled to time and a half for work in excess of forty (40) hours in a work week. Non-exempt employees include, but are not limited to clerical personnel, shop personnel, field technicians and hourly, non-commissioned sales personnel.</p>
                    <h3>Outside Employment and Appointments</h3>
                    <p>Employees are required to enter into a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement to work at Vancouver Bolt. Vancouver Bolt does not prohibit employees from outside employment or appointments to serve s an officer or director of another organization so long as the employment or appointment does not conflict with employee’s responsibilities to Vancouver Bolt. Vancouver Bolt holds employees to the same standards of performance and attendance regardless of outside employment or appointment. Employees should consider the effect outside employment or appointments will have on their performance, absenteeism and tardiness, etc.</p>
                    <p>No employee may be employed by or be an owner, shareholder, officer or director of any organization that competes with Vancouver Bolt. While employed by or serving as a director of another organization, employees may not represent Vancouver Bolt in any transaction or communication with that organization.</p>

                    <h2 id="wages">General Wage Policy</h2>
                    <p>It is our policy at Vancouver Bolt, to establish and maintain competitive wages that reflect such factors as general business conditions and wages paid in the area and industry.</p>

                    <h2 id="overtime">Overtime Distribution and Pay</h2>
                    <p>The decision to incur the expense of overtime is part of a Supervisor’s responsibility.  Employees may not work overtime unless directly instructed to do so in advance as overtime expense increases the cost of managing the business.</p>
                    <p>All employees classified as non-exempt by the Fair Labor Standards Act, must receive overtime payment of time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of forty [40] hours during any workweek unless the Davis-Bacon Act or a local law requires a different method of calculating pay.  The workweek begins at 12:01 A.M. on Monday, and ends at midnight on Friday.</p>
                    <p>Overtime pay is received only for time actually worked.  Vacation, holiday, sick days and meal breaks, are not considered time actually worked and are not included in calculating overtime pay during any workweek.</p>
                    <p>Non-exempt employees may receive time-off in lieu of extra hours worked when the time off is taken on an hour-for-hour basis, and is taken during the same workweek.  Overtime hours must be recorded on the appropriate payroll record.  Overtime hours may never be transferred to a different workweek.</p>

                    <h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
                    <p>To receive reimbursement for work-related travel, receipts are required for expenses.  Expenses for vehicle travel are reimbursed at a reimbursable rate that is within the allowable Internal Revenue Service rate, as a legitimate business expense.  Miles from home to your usual worksite, and return, are not considered a legitimate business expense by the Internal Revenue Service, and cannot be reimbursed.  It is important to park in the long-term parking lot at the airport to avoid extraordinary, and unnecessary, parking costs.</p>
                    <p>After any approved travel, create an accurate Expense Report supported by receipts, and submit it to the Accounting Department for approval.  It is important to submit expense reports within three days after the travel is completed to assure accurate financial reporting of the Company expenses.  Employees, who have an occasional mileage expense while on Company business, will also be reimbursed at a rate not greater than allowed by the IRS.</p>

                    <h2 id="trainingPay">Training Pay</h2>
                    <p>Employees engaged in Company-requested and supported training programs, will be paid at their regular rate of pay while attending these programs.  Travel to and from a training program is not considered as “hours worked” unless it occurs during usual work time.</p>

                    <h2 id="payday">Payday</h2>
                    <p>Employees of the Company are paid bi-weekly, on Friday.  If the regular payday is a holiday, employees are paid on the last working day before the holiday</p>

                    <h2 id="leaves">Leaves of Absence</h2>
                    <p>A Leave of Absence is an authorized absence from work, not to exceed three months.  Leaves of absence are for specific purposes, and must be approved in advance by the General Manager, Human Resources and President.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Holiday pay is not given during a Leave of Absence</li>
                        <li>Vancouver Bolt does not continue to pay premiums for health insurance coverage for employees on leaves of absence except as provided by law. However, you may self-pay the premiums under the provision of COBRA</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If an employee does not return to work at the conclusion of his/her Leave of Absence, the leave will be canceled, and employment will be terminated as a voluntary resignation.  The effective date of termination will be the last day</p>

                    <h2 id="militaryLeave">Military Leave</h2>
                    <p>Employees called into military training [U.S. Military Reserves/National Guard] will be provided unpaid leave time to meet the commitment.  Unpaid leave will also be offered to employees called to active duty due to a declared emergency, such as a flood or tornado.  Reinstatement will be granted according to the regulations for veterans returning to the workplace (USERRA).</p>

                    <h2 id="bereavement">Bereavement Pay</h2>
                    <p>We express sympathy to employees, by continuing the pay of an employee who must be absent due to a death in the immediate family.  Pay may be continued for up to two (2) days for full-time employees.  Immediate family is considered to be an employee’s spouse, child [including stepchild], sibling, parent or any other person who permanently lived at the employee’s residence.  Employees are offered time off with pay for absence to attend the services for other near relatives (grandparent, parent in-law).  The maximum time is one day.</p>
                    <p>Attendance at the service is mandatory to be considered paid leave.  The employee must notify the Supervisor as soon as possible of the need for funeral leave.</p>

                    <h2 id="juryDuty">Jury Duty</h2>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt & Supply recognizes the occasional civic obligations of our employees to serve on juries.  If you are summoned to serve for jury duty, please bring your subpoena and notify your Supervisor and the Human Resources Manager.  We will make arrangements for coverage in your absence.</p>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt will continue to pay exempt employees while they are serving on jury duty provided that the length of the jury duty leave is less than a work-week.  The company will not pay an exempt employee for any work-week when the employee is absent for the full work-week and preforms no work for the company.  Non-exempt employees will not receive wages while they are on jury duty leave.</p>
                    <p>Any employee summoned for jury duty may request a hardship letter from the Human Resources Manager.  If a hardship letter is needed, make your request as soon as possible.</p>

                    <h2 id="payrollDeductions">Mandatory Payroll Deductions</h2>
                    <p>Each pay period, when the payroll is calculated, we will make certain deductions from your pay.  These include Federal tax, State tax, any Local taxes mandated, and your FICA [Social Security] contribution.  We make mandatory deduction for taxes based on the information you have supplied through your W-4 forms.  When your status changes, you should complete new W-4 forms for withholding purposes.  The forms are available from the Payroll/Human Resources Dept.</p>

                    <h2 id="garnish">Wage Garnishments</h2>
                    <p>A wage garnishment is an order from a court or a government agency directing us to withhold a certain amount of money from an employee’s paycheck and send it to a person or agency.   If we are instructed by a court or agency to garnish an employee’s wages, the employee will be notified of the garnishment at once.  Please note that we are legally required to comply with these orders.  If you dispute or have concerns about the amount of a garnishment you must contact the court or agency that issued the order.</p>
                    <h2 id="voluntary">Voluntary Deductions</h2>
                    <p>When you want money deducted from your pay, for such things as Health Insurance Premiums or other non-mandatory withholdings, you must sign an authorization for the deduction.  Please contact your Supervisor, or Accounting Dept. to obtain the appropriate form [s].</p>

                    <h2 id="errorInPay">Error In Pay</h2>
                    <p>Every effort is made to avoid errors in your paycheck.  If you believe an error has been made, tell Payroll immediately and whenever possible within two (2) working days.  Payroll will take the necessary steps to promptly research the problem and correct any confirmed errors.</p>

                    <h2 id="parking">Employee Parking</h2>
                    <p>Parking is provided for employees.  There is no cost for employee parking and employees are expected to obey all traffic rules including parking spaces marked “handicapped.”  Park only in employee designated areas, along the fence on the north end of the building.  If space is not available there you must park on the street.  Never park in a space reserved for a customer or visitor.  Drive slowly in the parking lot and do not leave your valuables visible.  Be sure to lock your vehicle.</p>

                    <p>You and Vancouver Bolt, as your employer, each pay fifty percent [50%] of the cost of your Social Security contribution, as determined by Federal Law.  Your contribution is made through payroll deduction.  The tax-free benefits from this contribution are returned to you as Social Security benefits.</p>
                    <p>Social Security benefits are administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Only that agency of the Government makes a final determination as to whether, and in what amount, benefits may be received.</p>
                    <p>Specific questions concerning Social Security benefits should be directed to your Social Security Administration Office or to the Social Security site on the Internet.  Benefits under Social Security may be available at normal retirement, early retirement, disability retirement, and to the surviving spouse and dependent children of a deceased employee.  There may also be a death benefit paid to the survivors.</p>

Should you have an injury or illness directly related to your work, and incur medical expenses, these may be covered by the Worker’s Compensation Program.</p>
                    <p>The method for handling Worker’s Compensation claims, and the amount of the benefit, is based on your rate of pay and the standards set by the state in which you work.  Should you incur a work-related injury or illness, you must report it immediately to your Supervisor.  Failure to report a work-related injury or illness may cause your claim for benefits to be delayed or denied.  We require you to notify your Supervisor within 24 hours.  If you hold a position that requires you to use a commercial driver’s license, then you must report any work-related accident within one hour.</p>
                    <p>When a work-related injury or illness occurs, there is a specific procedure to be followed, including an official report that must be filed quickly.

                    </ol>

                    <h2 id="ethics">Code of Ethics</h2>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt & Supply has always been proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity.  This is one of its most important assets.  This can happen only if each of us does his or her best to maintain the highest standards of ethical behavior.  Our fundamental principles in this connection are that:</p>
                    <p>All federal, state and local laws must be obeyed.  Every one of Vancouver Bolt & Supply employees must follow the laws, which apply, to the conduct of its business.  These laws may vary from place-to-place and it is the responsibility of each employee to know and abide by different or additional local requirements.</p>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt & Supply forbids unlawful discrimination.  Vancouver Bolt policy is to provide equal employment opportunity and nondiscriminatory access to its goods and services.   Vancouver Bolt prohibits favoritism of any kind on the basis of age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and other legally protected characteristics during the conduct of business in the name of this company.</p>
                    <p>Bribes and “kickbacks” are strictly forbidden.  Both the acceptance of and the offering of bribes, kickbacks, or other unlawful payment(s) in any form are absolutely prohibited.  Occasional lunches, dinners or vendor-sponsored outings of nominal value which promote stronger business relationships are not prohibited.  No gifts may ever be offered to or accepted from government officials.</p>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt considers any false report, whether it is written or verbal, to be an ethics violation.</p>

                    <h2 id="differences">Resolving Differences</h2>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt is a reflection of you, and you are a reflection of the Company.  Please make every effort to be a willing Company employee.  It creates a productive workforce and a more pleasant work environment.  Our success depends on it.  Should you find that your work environment creates a decline in your productivity, talk it over with your Supervisor.  We try to make certain that our door of discussion is truly an “Open Door.”</p>

                    <h2 id="smoking">Smoking</h2>
                    <p>A mutually comfortable environment for the Company employees is dependent upon the thoughtfulness and cooperation of both non-smokers and smokers.  Please observe the rules regarding smoking wherever you work, whether on or off of company property.  Please remember that our workplace is tobacco free.  If you work in any area where there are flammables, please do not have anything in your possession that can create a flame, such as matches or a cigarette lighter.  </p>
                    <p><b>Smoking is to be done on rest periods and meal periods only.</b></p>

                    <h2 id="cleanliness">Cleanliness</h2>
                    <p>Workplace cleanliness impacts our image by those who visit us.  It is important to have a clean and professionally maintained office and work area.  Desks, and other work surfaces, must be clean and orderly.  Please do not allow coffee cups to accumulate in your work area.  If you are assigned a vehicle, it must be kept clean and in good repair.  The interior should be clean and orderly. </p>
                    <p>Keep food items in the refrigerator stored properly.   Foods left in the refrigerators more than 48 hours will be disposed of [including containers].</p>
                    <p>Unless essential, meals may not be eaten in any work area in the building.  </p>
                    <p>At the end of the workday, put away your work before leaving the building.  If you are the last employee to leave your area, be certain the lights and appliances [such as coffeepots, fans or heaters] are turned off.</p>

                    <h2 id="harassment">Employee Harassment</h2>
                    <p>Our workplace benefits from having a diverse group of employees.  You will work with other employees who are different from you, based on culture, gender, religion, national origin, race, and other differences.  Diversity brings strength to the workplace and our culture values each employee, regardless of difference.</p>
                    <p>Any form of harassment of employees, vendors or customers, is forbidden.  <b>The Company strongly opposes any form of harassment by any employee for any reason.</b> This includes harassing behavior based on religion, national origin, culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, color, or other differences.  Harassment may include disparaging comments about another person’s appearance, manner of dress, accent or any behavior that is abusive or offensive to another person, and creates a hostile work environment.  Comments made in a joking manner may easily be viewed to have a hostile intent.  It is wise to refrain from this behavior.</p>
                    <p>Harassment may also include sex harassment, such as requests for sexual favors, sexual demands as a condition of employment, using obscene or profane language, or any unwanted action of a sexual nature by employees, co-workers, or visitors.  Sex harassment may also be described as sexually-oriented conversation, sexually explicit photographs or accessing computer sites that display sexually-oriented or sexually graphic materials.  Sex harassment may be directed to a co-worker, subordinate, customer or vendor.</p>
                    <p>
                        Employees, who feel they have experienced any of the behaviors listed above, or other intimidating or threatening behaviors, are requested to report the incident immediately to their Supervisor or any other member of management.  All complaints will be investigated.  Based upon the results, disciplinary action will be taken against the offender[s], if appropriate.
                        Employees who observe, or have knowledge of any violation of this policy, should report
                        it immediately to a member of management.  We will take action when unforeseen events transpire, and look to employees for support of this policy.  If employees believe a threat exists to their safety or the safety of others, they are empowered to contact the proper law enforcement authorities without first informing management.  The telephone number is 911.
                    </p>
                    <p>You are encouraged to report any act of harassment at once.  An employee found to have engaged in harassing conduct will be severely disciplined up to, and including, discharge.  No employee will suffer retaliation in any form connected with work for reporting acts of harassment.</p>
                    <p>It is appropriate to file a report with your Supervisor, or any other member of management, if the action is against the supervisor.  The President/CEO is also eager to help you.  Every complaint will be promptly investigated.  We will follow a specific list of criteria when investigating a complaint, to be certain we have been thorough and fair.  We may invite a neutral third party, who specializes in the investigation of harassment matters, to assist us.  We may also require all parties to participate in alternative dispute resolution.  As much as is possible, we will protect the identity of the charging party.  When the investigation is complete, appropriate remedial action will be taken.  The charging employee will be informed that a resolution has been reached.</p>
                    <p>Please recognize that an accusation of harassment is very serious.  Any employee, who knowingly files a false claim of harassment against another person, will face severe discipline.</p>

The absence of or lack of explicit reference to a specific site, such as MySpace or Twitter, does not limit the extent of the application of this policy. </p>
                    <p>Postings to blogs or other social media sites should have clear disclaimers that the views expressed by the author in the blog are the views of the author and do not represent the views of the company.

Employees will not be permitted to distribute circulars, handbills, or literature of any type during their working time, or any other time, on the Company premises.  Many employees feel solicitation, by co-workers and/or Managers, is intimidating, and job-threatening.  Solicitation often causes ill will among employees.

If your work requires you to be in a hot, humid or poorly ventilated workplace, you will want to use a high quality antiperspirant.  Heavily applied perfumes, colognes, and/or after-shave lotions can cause an allergic reaction by some employees and may be offensive to others, especially in closed offices.</p>
                    <p>Jewelry must never interfere with equipment handling.  Body pierced jewelry, other than earrings, is forbidden.  Tattoos, with a message offensive to a reasonable person, must be kept covered.</p>

                    <p>No employee may bring alcoholic beverages, drugs, or any illegal substance, onto the Company property, or report for work under the influence of any intoxicant.  This includes prescription drugs not prescribed for the user.  Employees, who are found manufacturing, using, distributing, possessing or selling an illegal substance or an intoxicant, will be immediately disciplined up to, and including, discharge.  Employees seeking assistance with a substance abuse problem, such as alcohol or drugs, may contact their Supervisor.</p>
                    <p>As concerned employers, we must have a drug free workplace.  We will vigorously enforce policies that keep our workplace drug and alcohol free. If Vancouver Bolt & Supply has reasonable grounds to believe an employee has engaged in prohibited conduct in the recent past, or is, or may be engaged in prohibited conduct, the employee may be required to submit to drug testing.  If Vancouver Bolt and Supply has reasonable grounds to believe an employee is under the influence of alcohol, the employee may be required to submit to testing.</p>
                    <p>Vancouver Bolt reserves the right to conduct searches and inspections of employees’ personal effects, or Company-provided materials such as desks, lockers, computer equipment, cabinets, file drawers, packages or vehicles with appropriate notice, with the assistance of law enforcement authorities.</p>
                    <p>Any illegal and unauthorized articles discovered may be retained by Vancouver Bolt,    and/or may be turned over to law enforcement representatives.  Any Company employee who refuses to cooperate, or is found in possession of prohibited articles, will be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.</p>

                    <h2 id="discipline">Constructive Discipline</h2>
                    <p>Everyone at the Company has a responsibility to our customers, and to fellow employees.  This responsibility is that our work helps ensure that our customers receive the highest quality service every day.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you violate a work rule or established policy that is detrimental to our success, you may be subject to constructive discipline.
                    </p><p>Constructive discipline is designed to re-establish your positive relationship to the Company.  It may include counseling, reprimand, pay reduction, demotion or disciplinary suspension.  Should the circumstances of the violation require discharge, a policy has been adopted by the Company to ensure fair treatment of every employee.  There is no assurance that we will follow a lockstep procedure regardless of the inappropriate behavior.  Each instance will be evaluated separately.</p>
                    <p>When you are given a copy of a disciplinary action taken, it is to be certain you understand the problem that made disciplinary action necessary, and to serve as a reference for improvement.</p>
                    <p>Disciplinary actions are subject to the approval of the President/CEO.</p>

                    <h2 id="outsideEmployment">Outside Employment</h2>
                    <p>If you are a regular fulltime employee, your employment here is your primary employment.  You must notify the Company, in writing, if you have a second job, stating the nature of the outside employment, as well as the name and address of the outside employer.  Outside employment cannot interfere with regular Company employment, responsibilities and performance.  There may be certain employers that we feel are unacceptable as second employers for our employees.  If that is our decision, employment at that second employer will be prohibited.</p>

                    <h2 id="personalTools">Personal Use of Tools and/or Equipment</h2>
                    <p>Removing Company equipment from the property is prohibited unless written permission, which states the use and length of time needed, is given by a Supervisor.  When an employee is using equipment during non-work time, with permission from Vancouver Bolt, Vancouver Bolt will not accept responsibility for any mishap, including injury or death.  At the time of separation of employment, all Company equipment must be returned. </p>

                    <p>In the event of a building emergency, you will be expected to follow emergency instructions promptly.  Should you be hosting any visitor[s] in the building, you are responsible for making certain your visitor[s] follow the instructions of any management person handling a building evacuation emergency.</p>
                    <p>An evacuation plan is posted on the bulletin boards.  Review it often until you are comfortable with the evacuation route that will allow you to leave the building safely during an emergency.</p>

                    <h2 id="fire">Fire Emergency</h2>
                    <b>Remember:  Your role in an emergency is determined by WHERE you are --- not what you do!</b><br /><br />
                    <p>Things to Do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remain calm because panic interferes with our ability to react quickly and appropriately.</li>
                        <li>Exit the building calmly, checking for visitors and other staff as you leave.</li>
                        <li>Take visitors with you.</li>
                        <li>Close all doors behind you.</li>
                        <li>Inform firefighters where any wheelchairs are located.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Things NOT to Do:
                    <ul>
                        <li>DO NOT return for personal items</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Fire extinguishers are located throughout the building.  Learn where every fire extinguisher is located wherever you are working.  If you have a reason to use a fire extinguisher, do not return it to its holder.  Be certain it is given to a member of management to be certain it is re-charged.  If you have never been trained to use a fire extinguisher, we want to be sure you are trained, so tell your supervisor if you have not been trained in how to use a fire extinguisher.	</p>

                    <h2 id="tornado">Tornadoes or Severe Storms</h2>
                    <p>In the event of a tornado or severe storm, you may not have ample warning to reach a safe place.  We may learn of a tornado/storm warning from different sources:  employees’ personal radios, special weather radios, or civil defense warning.  A power outage is probable during severe weather.  Follow all emergency instructions provided during a Tornado Warning.</p>
                    <b>Remember:  Your role in an emergency is determined by WHERE you are --- not what you do!</b><br /><br />

                    <ul>
                        <li>Take cover under a piece of protective furniture, such as a desk or table. The furniture may “dance” across the floor; so be prepared to move with it.</li>
                        <li>If no table or desk is available, take cover in a reinforced area such as a doorway.  The goal is to protect your head from falling objects.</li>
                        <li>Don’t try to go outside.  There may not be time.  Move away from outside walls and windows.</li>
                        <li>If outside, move away from buildings or overhead towers.  Be especially careful of high-tension power lines.  Avoid elevated roadways and overpasses.</li>

                    <h1 id="lifting">Lifting Lessons</h1>

                    <h2>Object Weight</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <b>heavier the weight of the object</b>, the <b>greater the stress</b> will be to your back when lifting.
                        If possible, <u>reduce the weight of heavy loads</u> prior to moving them. This can often be accomplished by splitting the load in half.
                        Sometimes the weight of the load cannot be reduced. If the load is too heavy for you, either get help or use a mechanical lifting device.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Distance</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <b>further the object is from your body</b>, the<b> greater the stress</b> will be to your back when lifting. <u>
                            Position the object as close as
                            possible to your body
                        </u> <b>before</b> you begin the lift. This may require bringing the object to the edge of the shelf or pallet in preparation for the
                        lift. <b>Do not reach over other objects!</b> If other objects are in the way, either move them out of the way or move to a position where you are
                        able to get close to the object you are lifting. Try to store objects that are moved frequently in positions that allow you to get close to the
                        objects when lifting.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Height</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lifting the object from the ground is more stressful than lifting the same object from several inches off the ground. When possible, <u>
                            store
                            objects on platforms
                        </u> (i.e., shelves or pallets) that raise objects off the ground. Starting positions that are at a level between the knee and
                        waist are the least stressful to the back.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Acceleration</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <b>faster you accelerate</b> an object when lifting, the greater the stress will be to your back. Always lift with controlled speed to reduce
                        stress to your back. If the object is so heavy that you have to jerk the object to lift it, it is too heavy and you should either get help or
                        use a mechanical lifting device. Also, the <b>faster you decelerate</b> an object immediately before setting it down, the greater the stress will be
                        to your back. <u>Always lower objects with controlled speed</u>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Stance</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>A stance where the feet are too close together can increase stress</b> to the back if something unexpected happens (i.e., the load shifts,
                        someone bumps into you, your foot slips). Your initial reaction to the unexpected is either to prevent dropping the object you are lifting
                        or to prevent yourself from falling. In recovering your balance, you may twist your back or overexert your muscles. This can be prevented
                        by being prepared for the unexpected through use of a <u>wide stable stance</u>. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart to give you side-to-side
                        stability and staggered to give you forward and backward stability. Also, with this stance, you will be less tempted to twist during the lift.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Torso Stability</h2>
                    <p>The more <b>torso motion you allow during the lift</b>, the greater the stress to your back when lifting. Try to <u>keep your torso a stable unit</u></p>
                    <h2>Twisting</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Twisting during a lift</b> increases the stress to your back during lifting. Instead of twisting, <u>come to an upright position, then pivot,</u> using
                        your feet. Your feet should face where you lift object from and where you set an object down.
                    </p>

                    <h1 id="steps">Steps for Manual Lifting</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Assess the lifting environment</h2>
                            This is a mental process that takes just seconds before you begin the lift. Look at the surrounding area to become aware of possible hazards. Is the floor or ground level and dry? If not, you will need to take extra precautions during the lift. Do you know where you will place the object you are about to lift? If not, you may need to clear a place for the object before the lift. Is the pathway needed to perform the lift and/or carry the object clear? If not, you need to either take extra precautions or clear the pathway.

                            <h2>Assess the weight and size of the object.</h2>
                            Nudge the object to assess the approximate weight of the object. This will help you determine whether you can lift the object yourself or whether you need additional help from another person or a mechanical lifting device. Also, assess the size of the object. Often, bulky items are not heavy, but require additional help to maintain proper body mechanics during lifting, carrying, and lowering. Know your limitations and get additional help when necessary.

                                Move other objects out of the way or move yourself to a position where you can be close to the object you are about to lift.

                                Your feet should be approximately shoulder width apart with feet staggered slightly.

                                Bend your knees as far as you can and still be able to come to an upright position using your thigh muscles. If you have weak thighs, you may only be able to bend your knees slightly.
